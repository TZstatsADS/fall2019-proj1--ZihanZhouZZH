### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Project title: Lyric Characteristics of Different Music Genres
+ This project is conducted by Zihan Zhou (zz2573)

+ Project summary: This project tries to analyze lyric characteristics of different music genres, using the [dataset](output/processed_lyrics.RData) offered by the instruction team. I use barplots and wordclouds to visualize the data first, then do sentiment analysis to explore the emotions behind the scenes. Cluster analysis is also conducted.
